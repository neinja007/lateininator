# Lateininator

Project deployed at [lateininator.com](https://lateininator.com/dashboard). Also, I have somehow managed to get the term "lateininator" into the google search recommendations and the site is generally always on top when [searching for "lateininator"](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=lateininator&atb=v376-1&ia=web).

# Description

This project is a website that allows people to learn latin. It includes a [trainer for translations](https://lateininator.com/vocabulary/trainer), a [dictionary](https://lateininator.com/vocabulary/dictionary), various Latin inflections such as [declension](https://lateininator.com/flexion/noun) for nouns, [comparison](https://lateininator.com/flexion/adjective) for adjectives, and [conjugation](https://lateininator.com/flexion/verb) for verbs, and much much more. Also, the settings are very extensive.

# Why is the project public?

I don't know. I wanted to have a pin for a project that is actually of high quality and showcases all of my skills from authentication to postgreSQL and everything in between. The other public projects I have are a bit trash so this bonkers project is an attempt to tell stranger stalkers that I actually can code a little bit.
